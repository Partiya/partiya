🐼 Hey there, I'm Partiya! 👋
Welcome to my cozy little GitHub cave! I'm a full-stack panda 🐼💻 who munches on Next.js, T3 stack, Vue, Nuxt, and whatever JavaScript framework tastes good that day.

🌿 About Me
🏡 Live in the bamboo forests of Tehran, Iran
🎓 Studied Software Engineering at Tehran Shomal Azad University
🛠️ Code by day, nap by night—because productivity is just well-rested efficiency
💡 What I Do
I spend my time building cool things, like:

✈️ Flight booking & ticket buying systems (helping travelers, one ticket at a time!)
🛒 E-commerce applications (where pandas shop for bamboo, and you buy cool stuff)
🏆 Gold & GPS tracking systems (because pandas like to know where their treasures are!)
🛠️ My Tech Stack

I build things with:

🚀 Front-End: Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, React, TailwindCSS
🔥 Back-End: T3 Stack , Node js , Nest js  (TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, NextAuth)
